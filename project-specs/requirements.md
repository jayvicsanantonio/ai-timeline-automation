# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated system for gathering weekly AI-related news and events, analyzing their significance, and maintaining a curated timeline of major AI developments. The system will run weekly on Sundays, collect factual information about AI events from the past week, select the most significant developments, and automatically create a pull request to update a timeline repository with these events.

The primary goal is to maintain an up-to-date, factual record of major AI milestones without manual intervention, while ensuring quality through automated curation and pull request review processes. This will provide a valuable resource for tracking AI progress and keeping stakeholders informed about significant developments in the field.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Weekly Automated Execution
**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the system to run automatically every Sunday, so that the AI timeline stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Sunday 00:00 UTC arrives THEN the system SHALL trigger the news gathering process
2. IF the scheduled execution fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
3. WHILE the job is running THE system SHALL prevent duplicate executions
4. WHEN the job completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log execution details including duration and events found

### Requirement 2: AI News Gathering
**User Story:** As a content curator, I want the system to gather factual AI-related news from the past week, so that all significant events are considered for inclusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN gathering news THEN the system SHALL query multiple reliable AI news sources
2. IF a news item is retrieved THEN the system SHALL verify it occurred within the past 7 days
3. WHILE processing news items THE system SHALL extract: title, date, source, description, and impact category
4. WHEN duplicate events are found across sources THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and merge information
5. IF source APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with available sources and log failures

### Requirement 3: Event Selection and Ranking
**User Story:** As a timeline reader, I want only the most significant AI events included, so that the timeline remains focused on major developments.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing gathered events THEN the system SHALL rank them by significance using defined criteria
2. IF more than 3 significant events exist THEN the system SHALL select the top 3 based on impact score
3. WHILE ranking events THE system SHALL consider: technological breakthrough level, industry impact, adoption scale, and novelty
4. WHEN fewer than 3 significant events exist THEN the system SHALL include all events meeting minimum threshold
5. IF no events meet significance threshold THEN the system SHALL skip the PR creation for that week

### Requirement 4: Timeline Data Structure
**User Story:** As a developer, I want events stored in a consistent JSON format, so that the timeline can be easily consumed by applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating timeline entries THEN the system SHALL format each event with: id, date, title, description, category, sources, and impact_score
2. IF adding events to timeline-events.json THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological order
3. WHILE updating the file THE system SHALL preserve existing events without modification
4. WHEN generating event IDs THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness using date-based prefixes
5. IF JSON validation fails THEN the system SHALL halt PR creation and log the error

### Requirement 5: Pull Request Creation
**User Story:** As a repository reviewer, I want automated PRs with clear descriptions, so that I can quickly review and approve timeline updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating a PR THEN the system SHALL use branch name format: `auto-update/week-{year}-{week_number}`
2. IF the PR is created THEN the system SHALL include: summary of events added, sources consulted, and selection rationale
3. WHILE the PR is open THE system SHALL not create duplicate PRs for the same week
4. WHEN PR creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL add appropriate labels: "automated", "weekly-update"
5. IF PR creation fails THEN the system SHALL send notification to maintainers

### Requirement 6: Repository Structure
**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the automation in a new repository, so that it's separately managed from the timeline data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN setting up the repository THEN the system SHALL create separate repos for automation and timeline
2. IF deploying the automation THEN the system SHALL support GitHub Actions as the primary scheduler
3. WHILE running THE system SHALL have appropriate permissions to create PRs in the timeline repository
4. WHEN configuring access THEN the system SHALL use GitHub App or PAT for authentication
5. IF using external AI services THEN the system SHALL securely store API keys in repository secrets

### Requirement 7: Technology Selection
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the most appropriate AI tool for news analysis, so that the system is efficient and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN choosing AI tools THEN the system SHALL evaluate: API availability, cost, rate limits, and output quality
2. IF using LLM for analysis THEN the system SHALL implement structured output parsing
3. WHILE processing news THE system SHALL handle API rate limits gracefully
4. WHEN comparing tools THEN the system SHALL document trade-offs between Claude API, Vercel AI SDK, and alternatives
5. IF tool capabilities change THEN the system SHALL be architected to allow tool switching with minimal refactoring

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Monitoring
**User Story:** As an operator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed context including stack traces
2. IF critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL send notifications via configured channels
3. WHILE processing THE system SHALL track metrics: events gathered, events selected, API calls made, and processing time
4. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN the system SHALL use exponential backoff with jitter
5. IF the system fails repeatedly THEN it SHALL enter a degraded mode and alert maintainers
